There we will find the following

## 1. Introduction

## What you'll build

In this codelab we are going to take an existing simple WebGL app and extend it to be a full VR experience.

## What you'll learn

- Which Virtual Reality features are available on the web
- How to get information about the user's position and orientation from their device
- How to present a stereoscopic 3D scene to a VR-capable head-mounted display

## What you'll need

- A recent version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Note, this works in other browsers as well, but we'll be using a few features of the Chrome DevTools to better understand what's happening at the browser level.
- [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb), or your own web server of choice
- [The sample code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/webvr-codelab/archive/master.zip)
- A text editor
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)

This codelab is focused on WebVR. Non-relevant concepts and code blocks are glossed over and are provided for you to simply copy and paste.
